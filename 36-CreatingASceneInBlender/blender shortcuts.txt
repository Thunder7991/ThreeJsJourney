g = move
g+[x,y,z] = move one axis
g+[shift]+[z,y,x] = move all axis but one

s = scale

r = rotate

tab = toggle edit/object mode

shift + d = duplicate

alt + d = duplicate linked

z = toggle wireframe/solid/render

shift - wheel = move camera

edit mode -> control + l -> f3 -> bisect -> fill + clear outer = remove part of the object

edit mode -> select faces -> i -> left click -> transform orientation = normal -> 
check individual -> tweak thinkness -> left click = create inset

select inset faces -> e -> transform orientation = normal, transform pivot point = individual origins + right click, orientation = normal, tweak z axis

control + r -> wheel (change number of cuts) -> right click (default position) = loop cut

edit mode -> select face -> e[axis] = extrude 

object mode -> shift + a = add new mesh

select an object -> x = delete object

edit mode -> duplicate part of the geometry -> P -> selection = separate selection in another object (need to set origin to the new geometry)

edit mode -> control + l = select all faces

object mode -> f3 -> origin to geometry = center ogigin

object mode -> a = select all

f3 -> make single user single -> Object & data = unlink selected objects

move in edit mode to change origin, scale in object mode with the new origin to keep the object in the surface

keep the object far from the origin, duplicate and rotate to make a circle of objects around the origin

f3 -> repeat last = redo the last operation

check face orientation -> select red faces -> f3 -> flip = flip wrong oriented faces
or f3 -> recalculate outside

select object -> / = focus mode

a -> control + a = fix scales
